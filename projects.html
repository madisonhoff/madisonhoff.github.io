 <h2 style="color:#F778A1"> My data visualization work: </h2>
      <h3>Infographic</h3>
      I created an infographic on whether more Lehigh students are choosing to live. I was able to create this visualization through <a href="https://www.canva.com/">Canva</a> which gives me the tool to create a square infographic. <a href="Housing.html">

      <h3>Timeline</h3>
      I always enjoyed playing Pac-Man games, whether it be the original or a spin-off. I created a timeline on this history of the popular arcade game using <a href="https://timeline.knightlab.com/"> TimelineJS.</a> TimelineJS uses Google sheets to easily organize dates, texts, and pictures before converting it into a timeline. <a href="pacmantimeline.html">

      <h3>Line Chart</h3>
      I was interested in seeing the change in unemployment over time. The data I used was updated until the year 2013. To make this chart, I used <a href="https://quartz.github.io/Chartbuilder/">ChartBuilder </a> which allowed me to put my data into different charts and change the way it will appear.

         <h3>Map</h3>

      I like finding different places off-campus to eat so that I am not always eating dining hall food. I have a variety of different places on my list so I decided to create a map with their locations and information. To do so, I used <a href="https://support.google.com/fusiontables/answer/2571232?hl=en">Google Fusion </a>, which uses Excel sheets, cards, and a map to make all the data.

          <h3>Interactive visualization</h3>

      Putting data on a chart may not be too helpful to a viewer. They may want to look at a specific data point or to focus on one variable. Interactivity within the data visualization is therefore important. I created an interactive line chart about Lehigh graduation rates by ethnicity and race. To create this visualization, I used <a href="https://public.tableau.com/s/">Tableau Public </a>, which allows users to create interactive visualizations for free with an account.
