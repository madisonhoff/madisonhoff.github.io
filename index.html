<p>I am a student at Lehigh University. I'm studying journalism and computer science with the goal to find a job that can combine the two fields. In one of my journalism classes, we worked with data, data tools online, and Excel sheets to create visualizations of the data. I learned that don't just have data just because you want data, but find a question first and then use data and the right tool to write a story on this subject.</p>
 
      <h2> My data visualization work: </h2>
      <h3>Infographic</h3>
      I created an infographic on whether more Lehigh students are choosing to live on or off campus. I was able to create this visualization through <a href="https://www.canva.com/">Canva</a> which gives me the tool to create a simple square infographic. <a href="madisonhoff.github.io/Housing.html">

      <h3>Timeline:</h3>
      I always enjoyed playing Pac-Man games whether it be the original or a spin-off game. I created a timeline on the history of the popular arcade game, Pac-Man. I created this using <a href="https://timeline.knightlab.com/"> TimelineJS.</a><a href="madisonhoff.github.io/pacmantimeline.html">

      <h3>Line Chart</h3>
      I wanted to see the change in unemployment over time. The data I used was updated until the year 2013. To make this chart, I used <a href="https://quartz.github.io/Chartbuilder/">ChartBuilder </a>

         <h3>Map</h3>

      I like finding different places off-campus to eat on the weekends so that I am not always eating dining hall food. I have a variety of different places and have made a map with their locations and information. To do so, I used <a href="https://support.google.com/fusiontables/answer/2571232?hl=en">Google Fusion </a>, which uses Excel sheets, cards, and a map to make all the data.

          <h3>Interactive visualization</h3>

      Putting data on are chart may not be too helpful to the viewer. They may want to look at a specific data point or to focus on one variable. Interactivity within the data visualization is therefore important. I looked at how factors like ethnicity and race have played a role in the number of Lehigh graduates. T create this visualization, I used <a href="https://public.tableau.com/s/">Tableau Public </a>, which allows users to create interactive visualizations for free with an account.

      <p>I have written a few blog posts and written for the school newspaper during my time at Lehigh. Here is some of my work so far: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>I wrote a blog for my journalism class where I wrote about <a href="https://fivethingsfiveways.wordpress.com/2016/04/05/welcome-2/">Five Ways or Five things to do something </a> </li> 
     <li> I was one of a few selected students who wrote a blog for Lehigh's <a href="http://blueprintreflections.tumblr.com/"> bLUeprint program. </a> I wrote mainly about my first year experience and opportunities at Lehigh. </li>
    <li> I write for the school newspaper, The Brown and White. I write lifestyle articles which I find very exciting to write about other people's stories such as their businesses or clubs. <a href="http://thebrownandwhite.com/2016/02/25/lehigh-toys/"> Read about one of my articles on alumni women in the toy business. </a>
      </ul>
