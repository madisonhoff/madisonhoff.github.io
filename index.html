<p>I am currently a student at Lehigh University. I'm studying journalism and computer science with the goal to find a job that can combine the two fields. In one of my journalism classes, we worked with data, online data tools, and Excel or Google sheets to create visualizations of the data. I learned that you should not just include data in a story just so you have some statistics, but find a question first and then use data, if necessary, and the right tool to write a story on this subject.</p>

      <h3>Infographic</h3>
      I created an infographic on whether more Lehigh students are choosing to live. I was able to create this visualization through <a href="https://www.canva.com/">Canva</a> which gives me the tool to create a square infographic. <a href="madisonhoff.github.io/Housing.html">

      <h3>Timeline</h3>
      I always enjoyed playing Pac-Man games, whether it be the original or a spin-off. I created a timeline on this history of the popular arcade game using <a href="https://timeline.knightlab.com/"> TimelineJS.</a> TimelineJS uses Google sheets to easily organize dates, texts, and pictures before converting it into a timeline. <a href="madisonhoff.github.io/pacmantimeline.html">

      <h3>Line Chart</h3>
      I was interested in seeing the change in unemployment over time. The data I used was updated until the year 2013. To make this chart, I used <a href="https://quartz.github.io/Chartbuilder/">ChartBuilder </a> which allowed me to put my data into different charts and change the way it will appear.

         <h3>Map</h3>

      I like finding different places off-campus to eat so that I am not always eating dining hall food. I have a variety of different places on my list so I decided to create a map with their locations and information. To do so, I used <a href="https://support.google.com/fusiontables/answer/2571232?hl=en">Google Fusion </a>, which uses Excel sheets, cards, and a map to make all the data.

          <h3>Interactive visualization</h3>

      Putting data on a chart may not be too helpful to a viewer. They may want to look at a specific data point or to focus on one variable. Interactivity within the data visualization is therefore important. I created an interactive line chart about Lehigh graduation rates by ethnicity and race. To create this visualization, I used <a href="https://public.tableau.com/s/">Tableau Public </a>, which allows users to create interactive visualizations for free with an account.

      <p>I have written a few blog posts and written for the school newspaper during my time at Lehigh. Here is some of my work so far: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>I wrote a blog for my journalism class where I wrote about <a href="https://fivethingsfiveways.wordpress.com/2016/04/05/welcome-2/">Five Ways or Five things to do something </a> </li> 
     <li> I was one of a few selected students who wrote a blog for Lehigh's <a href="http://blueprintreflections.tumblr.com/"> bLUeprint program during Spring 2016. </a> I wrote mainly about my first year experience and opportunities at Lehigh. </li>
    <li> I write for the school newspaper, The Brown and White. I write lifestyle articles which I find very exciting because I like to write about other people's stories such as their businesses or clubs. <a href="http://thebrownandwhite.com/2016/02/25/lehigh-toys/"> Read about one of my articles on alumni women in the toy business. </a>
      <li> Want to read more articles by me? <a href="http://thebrownandwhite.com/author/mgh319/">Here is a list of articles I wrote on the Brown and White.  </a>
