<p>I am currently a senior at Lehigh University. I'm studying journalism and cognitive science with a minor in data science. My goal is to find a job that combines these three stuides. I have gained experience through classes and work. For instance, I was associate graphics and data editor for Lehigh University's student-run newspaper, <i> The Brown and White </i>. In one of my journalism classes, I also analyzed data, used online data tools, and Excel, Google sheets, Tableau Public and other applications to create visualizations of the data. I have learned about how to clean data, analyze data, identify patterns, create charts, and the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning through machine learning, data science, and statistics courses. I have used Python and R to take online datasets to evaluate the best model for the dataset. I trained, tested, and validated different supervised models to decide which model was the best before using it on future data. I used classification reports and confusion matrices to compare the models. </p>
