<p>I am a recent graduate of Lehigh University where I earned a bachelors in journalism and cognitive science with a minor in data science. I have gained experience through classes, internships, and relevant activities. For instance, I was associate graphics and data editor for Lehigh University's student-run newspaper, <i> The Brown and White </i>. In one of my journalism classes, I also analyzed data, used online data tools, and Excel, Google sheets, Tableau Public and other applications to create visualizations of the data. I have learned about how to clean data, analyze data, identify patterns, create charts, and the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning through machine learning, data science, and statistics courses. I have used Python and R to take online datasets to evaluate the best model for the dataset. I trained, tested, and validated different supervised models to decide which model was the best before using it on future data. I used classification reports and confusion matrices to compare the models. </p>
      <p>I have worked in two journalism internships where I wrote about an array of topics in news and lifestyle. I have also have leadership experience from working on the editorial board at <i> The Brown and White </i> including being editor in chief. </p>
