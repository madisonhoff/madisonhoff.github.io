<p>I am a student at Lehigh University. I'm studying journalism and computer science with the goal to find a job that can combine the two fields.</p>
      <h3> My data visualization work: </h3>
      <h4>Infographic</h4>
      I created an infographic on whether more Lehigh students are choosing to live on or off campus. I was able to create this visualization through <a href="https://www.canva.com/">Canva</a> which gives me the tool to create a simple square infographic. <a href="madisonhoff.github.io/Housing.html">

<br>
      <h4>Timeline</h4>
      I always enjoyed playing Pac-Man games whether it be the original or a spin-off game. I created a timeline on the history of the popular arcade game, Pac-Man. I created this using <a href="https://timeline.knightlab.com/"> TimelineJS.</a><a href="madisonhoff.github.io/pacmantimeline.html">

      <h4>Line Chart</h4>
      I wanted to see the change in unemployment over time. The data I used was updated until the year 2013. To make this chart, I used <a href="https://quartz.github.io/Chartbuilder/">ChartBuilder </a>

      <h3>
        
         <h4>Map</h4>

      I like finding different places off-campus to eat on the weekends so that I am not always eating dining hall food. I have a variety of different places and have made a map with their locations and information. To do so, I used <a href="https://support.google.com/fusiontables/answer/2571232?hl=en">Google Fusion </a>, which uses Excel sheets, cards, and a map to make all the data.

      <h3>
        
          <h4>Interactive visualization</h4>

      Putting data on are chart may not be too helpful to the viewer. They may want to look at a specific data point or to focus on one variable. Interactivity within the data visualization is therefore important. I looked at how factors like ethnicity and race have played a role in the number of Lehigh graduates. T create this visualization, I used <a href="https://public.tableau.com/s/">Tableau Public </a>, which allows users to create interactive visualizations for free with an account.
