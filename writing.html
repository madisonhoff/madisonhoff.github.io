          <h3>University Communications</h3>

     I have interned in editorial services at University Communications since this past summer. I wrote a few articles for the university's magazine including the Lehigh Bulletin and The Lehigh Business Magazine. In addition, I wrote a few articles online. A few are a few of my favorite articles I wrote: 
   <ul>
    <li> I <a href="https://www1.lehigh.edu/news/students-show-their-entrepreneurial-spirit" target="_blank"> wrote</a> about three student winners of the Leonard Pool Prize after they started various businesses.</li>
    </li> I <a href="https://www1.lehigh.edu/news/cochlear-implant-simulation-app-under-development" target="_blank"> wrote</a> about one of the Lehigh Mountaintop teams this past summer. This team worked on a cochlear implant simulation app for parents and others to use to understand what cochlear implant users hear. </li>
   </li> I <a href="https://www1.lehigh.edu/news/lehigh-shines-at-fintech" target="_blank"> wrote</a> about Lehigh students who won at a Fintech hackathon. </li>

   </ul>
