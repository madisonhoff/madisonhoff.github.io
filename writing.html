      Putting data on a chart may not be too helpful to a viewer. They may want to look at a specific data point or to focus on one variable. Interactivity within the data visualization is therefore important. I created an interactive line chart about Lehigh graduation rates by ethnicity and race. To create this visualization, I used <a href="https://public.tableau.com/s/">Tableau Public </a>, which allows users to create interactive visualizations for free with an account.

      <p>I have written a few blog posts and written for the school newspaper during my time at Lehigh. Here is some of my work so far: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>I wrote a blog for my journalism class where I wrote about <a href="https://fivethingsfiveways.wordpress.com/2016/04/05/welcome-2/">Five Ways or Five things to do something </a> </li> 
     <li> I was one of a few selected students who wrote a blog for Lehigh's <a href="http://blueprintreflections.tumblr.com/"> bLUeprint program during Spring 2016. </a> I wrote mainly about my first year experience and opportunities at Lehigh. </li>
    <li> I write for the school newspaper, The Brown and White. I write lifestyle articles which I find very exciting because I like to write about other people's stories such as their businesses or clubs. <a href="http://thebrownandwhite.com/2016/02/25/lehigh-toys/"> Read about one of my articles on alumni women in the toy business. </a>
